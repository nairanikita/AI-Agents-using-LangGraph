# You should express what you want a model to do by  
# providing instructions that are as clear and  
# specific as you can possibly make them. 
# This will guide the model towards the desired output, 
# and reduce the chances of receiving irrelevant 
# or incorrect responses. Don't confuse writing a 
# clear prompt with writing a short prompt. 
# In many cases, longer prompts provide more clarity 
# and context for the model, which can lead to 
# more detailed and relevant outputs.

Got this for my daughter for her birthday cuz she keeps taking \
mine from my room.  Yes, adults also like pandas too.  She takes \
it everywhere with her, and it's super soft and cute.  One of the \
ears is a bit lower than the other, and I don't think that was \
designed to be asymmetrical. It's a bit small for what I paid for it \
though. I think there might be other options that are bigger for \
the same price.  It arrived a day earlier than expected, so I got \
to play with it myself before I gave it to my daughter.
